# Welcome to Zabiplane!

## Mission Statement

In order to address the issues with today’s SDN dataplanes (market fragmentation, poor tooling/introspection, inflexibility), the members of the Zabiplane project will build a next generation open source dataplane that is as general purpose as possible, while retaining high levels of performance, observability, usability, and maintainability.  It should be an exemplar of open source community practices and should ship with all Linux distributions.  By being highly programmable, it will be able to support the most common networking and security features, span most of L2-L7, and plug into any SDN control plane (open or closed).
