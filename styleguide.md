# Styleguide for the Community repo

This styleguide is for this repo only, not for any other Zabiplane repos.

## Project name

It's `Zabiplane` with a lowercase p. It's not camelcase `ZabiPlane`. The latter is just asking for people to spell it wrong, plus it's harder to type, so we don't use it.

## Filenames

* Aside from certain special files (LICENSE, Code-of-Conduct, etc), all directories and filenames are _lowercase_ with no separators (-, _, space, etc.)

## File organisation

* If there will be more than one file related to a single topic (Working Groups, for instance), please create a new directory to contain them.
* Every directory must have a README.md file.

## File format

* Except for certain special files (LICENSE), all document files in this repo must be in Markdown.
* The character used for unordered lists is `*`.
* Ordered lists should use `1.` for each item in the list. Don't try to keep these sequentially numbered. Markdown will handle that for you.
* All links are inline (`[link text](url)`), not [reference type links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links).

## Language

* The primary language of the Zabiplane language is English. Translations are very much welcome.
* While the preference of the initial author of these pages is for Commonwealth English (colour, organisation), American spellings are also welcome (color, organization).
