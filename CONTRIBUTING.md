# Join the Zabiplane Community!

Thank you for your interest in the Zabiplane community! Please remember that all who participate in the Zabiplane community agree to operate according to the [Code of Conduct](./Code-of-Conduct.md).

The majority of the work right now is happening on the mailing list and in working group meetings…

## Mailing list

We have a [mailing list](https://zabiplane.groups.io/g/dev) on Groups.io. All are welcome to join it. If you just want to catch up on the conversations, the entire [mailing list archive](https://zabiplane.groups.io/g/dev/topics) is public and searchable.

Please note: For a few months prior to the creation of the Zabiplane mailing list, the community used a different `ebplane` mailing list running on the Red Hat mailman. Almost all of the messages to it were administrative as we worked to schedule meetings and such. That list is now deprecated, but its [archives](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/private/ebplane/index.html) are available to former subscribers.

## Working groups

Joining a [working group](./workingroups/README.md) is a great way to get involved!

All working group meetings are on the [community calendar](https://zabiplane.groups.io/g/dev/calendar).

## Repositories

At the time I'm writing this document, there are no other repositories beyond this one. Right now nearly all of the work is designing, researching, and related preparations. We'll update this with more information once other repos exist.

Questions, suggestions, and bug reports are all valid contributions as well! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Zabiplane/Community/issues/new).

## Community questions, tasks, or bugs

All tasks, questions, and bugs related to the Zabiplane community are tracked in the issues in this repo. For example…

* Need a new mailing list created? Open an issue.

* Don't have merge access on a repo? Open an issue.
* Have a suggestion for a change in Zabiplane community governance? Open an issue.

Please remember that opening an issue doesn't mean you'll necessarily get that repo access (for instance), but it does allow us to track the work and the consolidate the conversation around it.

### Side note: Project history

If you're interested, we maintain a [project history](./history.md) to give new community members some background and context to help them get going.
