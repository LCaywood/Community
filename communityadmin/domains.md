# Information about the project domain names

## The names we have registered

As soon as we had a name for the project we registered the following domain names, then voted for which one should be primary:

* zabiplane.com
* zabiplane.dev
* zabiplane.io
* zabiplane.net
* zabiplane.org

After the vote, the community decided that `zabiplane.io` is the primary domain. All of the others have been redirected to point to the `.io`.

## Registrar and registrant

The domains are registered at Namecheap.com. They're currently registered by VM Brasseur and are all set to auto-renew against her work credit card.

Should the project decide to move to a fiscal sponsor/conservator of some sort, we'll transfer the domains to them.
