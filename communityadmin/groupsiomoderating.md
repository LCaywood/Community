# Moderating a groups.io Group (aka mailing list)

Our mailing lists are hosted on [groups.io](https://groups.io). Our primary list, [dev@](https://zabiplane.groups.io/g/dev), is currently set so anyone can subscribe to it but everyone's first message to the list is moderated. 

This is intended to cut down on spam, but it does mean we need attentive and responsive list moderators to make sure new community members can get their questions and comments posted to the list as quickly as possible rather than delayed in moderation for days.

## Responsibilities of a groups.io moderator

This list of responsibilities is deceptively small:

* Keep an eye on the moderation queue (you'll receive email notifications)
* Approve or reject messages rapidly, ideally within an hour on business days

That second responsibility is the tricky one. As a moderator, the community relies on you to get those messages approved quickly so new members don't get frustrated and walk away. You have a vital role in the first impression that people will have of the community. You're very important to community success.

## Qualifications of a groups.io moderator

* Be an active Zabiplane community member in good standing
* Be willing to take on the responsibilities of being a moderator, especially the rapid approval of valid messages from new community members
* Be willing to support and collaborate with your fellow moderators. Don't simply let everyone else do the work or, even worse, let it all fall on a single moderator

## Becoming a groups.io moderator

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/Zabiplane/Community/issues/new) in this repo asking to become one
  * Opening an issue is not guarantee of becoming a moderator
  
Yup, it's that easy.

## Current moderators of the dev@ list

* VM Brasseur
* Carlo Contavalli
* Gary Greenberg
